# itube-dl-button
This project provides user scripts for embedded web controls on web media players to download and convert the media with simple click. For now it uses aimersoft iTube as downloader and converter, but it should be pretty simple to adapt to another program or a self made solution. My plan is to develop it step by step to a own independent plugin for browsers.
